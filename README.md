# Wine review API in Go

This tutorial is supposed to be worked on independently, but there are checkpoints along the way.

## To Begin
Checkout the branch **step1** to start, each step has a corresponding completion branch -  **step1-completion** for example.

To view the full solution, checkout **complete**, here you will see all steps in the README.md file, as well as a proposed solution.

Please note that this is not intended to be a representative of a full production codebase, it exists for the purpose of this tutorial, there are many and probably better ways to get to the end state.

## Step 1

### The Data**
We have found a set of data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews#winemag-data-130k-v2.csv) that we have downloaded into the **/resources directory. There are two files, one with 130k records, and another with 20 records. I would suggest working with the csv with 20 records for when developing.

Have a look at the kaggle link above, and check out the csv format - in particular we will be interested in the following attributes:

* ID
* Title
* Variety
* Country
* Points
* TasterName

### The Challenge
Create a go program that will read a csv file and print out the following information:

```
2019/03/31 13:30:35 Starting application
2019/03/31 13:30:35 Number of reviews: 20
2019/03/31 13:30:35 Most prolific Reviewer: Michael Schachner
2019/03/31 13:30:35 Most reviewed variety: Gew√ºrztraminer
2019/03/31 13:30:35 Finished the application
```

Run the program by simply use the following command
``` sh
go run main.go
```
